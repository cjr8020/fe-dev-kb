AOT Compilation
***************

	$ ng build --prod --aot=true 


When you build your Angular application, it uses Just in Time Compilation (JIT) by default. 

This means that your Angular application is compiled inside the browser at runtime. As you can imagine this can be slow.


To take your build optimization a level further, you can build your Angular production code using Ahead of Time Compilation (AOT). With AOT, your Angular application is compiled at build-time, that is before it gets to the browser. Here are some reasons why you should use AOT.

- faster rendering
- smaller app size
- better code quality
- secure and robust since templates are not eval'ed dynamically

One disadvantage is that CI/CD may take longer.


Angular build-optimizer
************************


The build optimizer removes Angular specific decorators, constructor parameters and makes it easier for code minifiers to remove unused code.


$ ng build --prod --aot=true --buildOptimizer=true 


NOTE: ONLY WORKS ON AOT COMPILED CODE





webpack-bundle-analyzer
************************


	$ npm install --save-dev webpack-bundle-analyzer

scripts:

	"bundle-report": "npm run clean && ng build --prod --stats-json && webpack-bundle-analyzer dist/<project-name>/stats.json"

	$ npm run bundle-report



source-map-explorer
********************

	$ sudo npm install source-map-explorer -g


In project:

script:

    "source-map": "npm run clean && ng build --prod --source-map",

	$ source-map-explorer dist/<project-name>/main.f6d8a3b72b8896a1ae13.js

	$ source-map-explorer dist/<project-name>/scripts.7468e82cfd2c8bcd9aa6.js
