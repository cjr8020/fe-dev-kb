================================================================================

Upgrading to Angular 6
***********************	


Node version 8.9+ or newer

angular/cli

	update angular/cli gloabally and locally

		$ npm install -g @angular/cli
		$ npm install @angular/cli
		$ ng update @angular/cli

	update all your Angular framework packages to v6

		$ ng update @angular/core
		$ ng update @angular/material

	RxJS v6 has major changes from v5.
	v6 brings backwards compatibility package rxjs-compat that will keep your applications working, but you should refactor TypeScript code so that it doesn't depend on rxjs-compat. To refactor TypeScript code run following:

		$ npm install -g rxjs-tslint
		$ rxjs-5-to-6-migrate -p src/tsconfig.app.json


	Once all of your dependencies have updated to RxJS 6, remove rxjs- compat as it increases bundle size. please see this RxJS Upgrade Guide for more info.

		$ npm uninstall rxjs-compat
