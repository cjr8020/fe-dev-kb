	CSS Syntax

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@


Applied to a tag. E.g.:

	div { color: red; }
	
Class:

	.callout { ... }

Subclass

	.classA {...}	
	.classA .subclassAA {...}

	<div class="classA">
		<table><tr><td class="subclassAA" ..
	
	
Combined tag/class:

	span.highlight { ... }
	
Id

	#close { ... }


Style Rule
----------

consists of two parts:
	- selector
	- style declaration
	
================================================================================

	CSS Selector
	************

CSS element selector
--------------------


	CSS selector without (.) target all HTML elements by this tag, e.g.

	  p {
	    color: green;
	  }


CSS class selector
------------------

	matches elements based on the contents of their 'class' attribute.
	although a selected element may have mutliple classes, one of them must 
	match exactly the class name given in the selector.

	E.g.

		CSS

			div.classy { .. }  

		HTML

			<div class="classy">
  
	CSS selector with (.)   specifies a class, e.g. 

	  .green {
	    color: green;
	  }  

	  <p class="green">i'm going green</p>
	  <p>i'm just plain paragraph</p>
	  <p class="green">i'm going green too!</p>



 CSS id selector
 ---------------

	CSS selector with (#)   specifies an ID, e.g. 

	  #myElement {
	    ...
	  }

	You can have ONLY one element with a particular ID.
	But you can have many elements in a particular class.
	So, if you want to target once specific element, you can give that element an ID,
	and target it with a hash ('#') in your CSS statement.



More specific CSS Selectors
---------------------------

find all TAGs that have particular class
e.g. 

  .warning {
    background-color: red;
    color: white;
  }

  // this finds all <p> paragraphs with the class of "warning"
  p.warning {
    border: 5px solid orange;
  }

find all X tags inside an element that has a particular class
e.g.

  .warning {
    background-color: red;
    color: white;
  }
  // this finds all <p> tags inside an element that has a class of "warning"
  .warning p {

  } 



applies style to <a.active> elements inside <nav> elements

    nav a.active {
      color: #03d465;
    }




	
- Tag-type selectors


	To upply a rule only to <h1> tags that are contained within a <div> tag:
	
		div h1 { color: red; }
		
	These are also referred to as element-based selectors, because they decide whether or not a DOM element is styled based on its element type.

	
- class-based selectors

	E.g, if we define a style class called 'callout', which is to appear in a colored box, we could write:
	
		.callout { border: solid blue 1px; background-golor: cyan }
		
	To assign a style class to an element, we simply declare a class attribute in the html tag:
	
		<div>I'll appear as a normal bit of text</div>
		<div class="callout">And I'll appear as a callout!</div>
		
	Elements can be assigned more than one class. 
	
		<div class='callout loud'>And I'll appear as a mixture of both</div>

		
- element-based selectors

	we can combine classes with element-based rules, to define a class that operates only on a particular tag types:
	
		span.highlight { background-color: yellow }
		
	this will be applied to <span> tags with a declared class attribute of "highlight".  Other <span> tags, or other types of tag with class='highlight', will be unaffected.
	
	We can also use these in conjunction with the parent-child selectors to create very specific rules:
	
		div.prose span.highlight { backgroun-color: yellow }
		
	This will be applied only to <span> tags of class 'highlight' that are nested within <div> tags of class 'prose'.
	

	
- id-based selector

	No more than one element should have a given ID assigned to it, so these selectors are typically used to select a single element on a page.
	
		#close { color: red }
	
	This is applied to a button with id="close".

	
- pseudo-selectors

	A web browser defines a limited number of pseudo-selectors.

		*:first-letter {
			font-size: 500%;
			color: red;
			float: left;
		}
		
	will draw the first letter of any element in a large bold red font.  We can tighten up this rule:
	
		p.illuminated:first-letter {
			...
		}
	
	The red border effect will now apply only to <p> elements with a declared class of 'illuminated'.  Other pseudo-selector include:
	
		first-line
		hover
	


================================================================================

CSS style properties
====================

	Elements can be hidden from view by setting 'visibility:hidden' or 'display:none'
	
	
	
Using CSS for layout
--------------------

	To position elements, the outermost element, representing the window is assigned an absolute position:
	
		div.window {
			position: absolute;
			overflow: auto;
			margin: 8px;
			padding: 0px;
			width: 420px;
			height: 280px;
		}
		
	Within the content area,  the icons are styled using the 'float' property so as to flow within the confines of their parent element, wrapping around to a new line:
	
		div.item {
			position: relative;
			height: 64px;
			width: 56px;
			float: left;
			padding: 0px;
			margin: 8px;
		}
			
	The itemName element, which is nested inside the 'item' element, has the text positioned below the icon by setting the upper margin as large as the icon graphic:
	
		div.item div.itemName {
			margin-top: 48px;
			font: 10px verdana, arial, helvetica;
			text-align: center;
		}
			
Using CSS for styling
---------------------

	The graphics used by the items in the folder are assigned by class name:
	
	div.folder {
		background: 
			transparent url(images/folder.png)
			top left no-repeat;
	}
	
	div.file {
		background:
			transparent url(images/file.png)
			top left no-repeat;
	}
	
	div.special {
		background:
			transparent url(images/filder_important.png)
			top left no-repeat;
	}

	CSS Positioning
	***************
	
The CSS positioning properties allow you to position an element. It can also place an element behind another, and specify what should happen when an element's content is too big.

Elements can be positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. However, these properties will NOT work unless the position property is set first. 


Four different positioning methods:

1. Static
---------

	(default) A static positioned element is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page.  
	
	Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.

2. Fixed
--------

	An element with fixed position is positioned relative to the browser window.  It will not move even if the window is scrolled.
	
	p.pos_fixed
	{
		position:fixed;
		top:30px;
		right:5px;
	}
	
	Fixed positioned elements are removed from the normal flow. The document and other elements behave like the fixed positioned element does not exist.
	
	Fixed positioned elements can overlap other elements.

3. Relative
-----------

	A relative positioned element is positioned relative to its normal position.
	
	The content of a relatively positioned elements can be moved and overlap other elements, but the reserved space for the element is still preserved in the normal flow.
	
	Relatively positioned element are often used as container blocks for absolutely positioned elements.

4. Absolute
-----------

	An absolute position element is positioned relative to the first parent element that has a position other than static. If no such element is found, the containing block is <html>
	
	Absolutely positioned elements are removed from the normal flow. The document and other elements behave like the absolutely positioned element does not exist.
	
	Absolutely positioned elements can overlap other elements.
	
	
Overlapping Elements
====================

	When elements are positioned outside the normal flow, they can overlap other elements.
	
	The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element (which element should be placed in front of, or behind, the others).
	
	An element can have a positive or negative stack order.
	
	An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.
	
	img
	{
		position:absolute;
		left:0px;
		top:0px;
		z-index:-1
	}
	
	
=================================================================

	background
	**********
	
background 'repeat' property sets if/how a background image will be repeated.

By default, a background-image is repeated both vertically and horizontally.

Property values:

	repeat  	
		The background image will be repeated both vertically and horizontally. This is default
	
	repeat-x 	
		The background image will be repeated only horizontally
	
	repeat-y 	
		The background image will be repeated only vertically
	
	no-repeat 	
		The background-image will not be repeated
	
	inherit 	
		Specifies that the setting of the background-repeat property should be inherited from the parent element

	
=================================================================	
		
	animation
	*********

achieved using two mechanisms:

1. CSS transitions

	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions

2. 	CSS Animations

	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations


transition 

	CSS start state
	CSS end state
	transition effect

	the effect is defined using the style property 'transition'
	Here, the background color is changed from black to blue on hover with a transition effect defined by the 'transition' property.

		.my-class {
			-webkit-transition:0.5s linear all;
			transition:0.5s linear all;
			background:black;
		}	
		.my-class:hover {
			background:blue;
		}

	you're not limited to pseudo selector like hover..

		.my-class.animate {
			background:blue;
		}

	when you add 'animate' class to an HTML element which already has 'my-class', the background will change with the transition effect defined.

animation

	CSS start state	
	keyframe configuration that defines the time duration of the animation 

		.my-class {
			background:black;
		}
		.my-class:hover {
			background :blue;
			animation:color 1s linear;
			-webkit-animation: color 1s linear;
		}
		@keyframes color {
			from {
				background: black;
			}
			to {
				background: blue;
			}
		}

The basic difference between transition and animation is that we do not need two CSS states defined in the case of animation.		

In the first example, transition happens when the CSS on the element changes from .my-class to .my-class:hover

whereas in the 2nd example, animation starts when the CSS state is .my-class:hover, so there is no end CSS concept with animation.
