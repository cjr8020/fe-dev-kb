    innerbuilder Intellij Plugin
    ****************************

https://github.com/analytically/innerbuilder

adds a 'Buider' action to the Generate menu (Alt+Ins) which 
generates an inner builder class as discussed in Effective Java.    


Usage

Use Shift+Alt+B or Alt+Insert and select Builder.... Choose the fields to be included and press OK. When generating a builder when a builder already exists, the plugin will try to update it. It will add missing fields and builder methods, but never remove any fields or methods.


================================================================================
  
    Maven Helper Plugin
    *******************

http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7179

Dependency Analyzer:

    Open pom file, click on 'Dependency Analyzer' tab, right click in the tree for context actions.


Right click in Editor or in Project View

    Run Maven


Since IDEA v 14.x - Dependency Diagram does not show conflicts
Issue: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-133331
    IDEA-133331

FIX:

    if your project is Maven2 compatible, you could try one of the following:

        you could try to add -Dmaven3.use.compat.resolver option to File | Settings | Build, Execution, Deployment | Build Tools | Maven | Importing | VM options for importer

            NOTE: -Didea.maven3.use.compat.resolver in IJ 14.1

            (this worked for me..)

        or turn off File | Settings | Build, Execution, Deployment | Build Tools | Maven | Importing | Use Maven3 to import project setting


================================================================================

    Maven effective POM
    *******************

Use the Maven Projects tool window, right click on the project, Show Dependencies




    compact empty middle packages
    *****************************

disabling this setting will list every package level on their own line

    Tool window quick access
    ************************

Click button in the lower left corner of the workspace - this provide quick access to tool windows.

    Intellij - why so red?
    **********************

Language level changed
maven projects - problem with maven dependencies

IntelliJ sometime gets confused after importing maven projects and then changing poms externally or generating sources outside IntelliJ.

You might want to try a maven->force reimport from within intellij on the project root

     oddly enough, this actually caused a "red alert condition" for me that invalidating caches subsequently cleared


================================================================================

    Restore Defaults
    ****************

delete the whole configuration folder ${user.home}/.IntelliJIdea60/config



================================================================================

    Added Generated Sources as src directory
    ****************************************
http://wiki.jetbrains.net/intellij/Maven_FAQ

In order to get generated sources automatically imported as source folders configure corresponding plugins so that they put them into target/generated-sources/<subdir>, where subdir is any folder name you prefer. The subdir folder is necessary to distinguish sources from different tools and also to exclude some special generated sources (e.g. groovy stubs).

Any time you want to generate sources you simply execute the corresponding goal, bound for generation (usually generate-sources, generate-test-sources). After that IDEA will pick up new folders and set them up.

Generated test sources/resources should be placed in target/generated-test-sources/<subdir>.


Generated Sources in Non-standard location
------------------------------------------

If it is not possible to configure the plugin you should use Update Folders action available from Maven Projects tool window and for each Maven project in the list. This action takes special steps to discover plugin configuration and configure source folders.
To specify a phase that should be used during this action go to Settings->Maven->Import.
