design tokens

 are an agnostic way to store variables such as typography, color, and spacing 
 so that your design system can be shared across platforms 
 like iOS, Android, and regular ol’ websites.

Let’s take just one example: 

you probably have a typographic scale that you want to be identical across a bunch of platforms

Instead of storing the values for that scale in a CSS file and replicating them in every app or website, they can be stored in a JSON file that will then be transformed into the code needed for all those other platforms.

    "type": "token",

  },
  "aliases": {
    "TYPE_SIZE_SM": {
      "value": "14px"
    },
    "TYPE_SIZE_MD": {
      "value": "25px"
    },
    "TYPE_SIZE_LG": {
      "value": "44px"
    }
 },
