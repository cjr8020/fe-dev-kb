cloud computing advantages

- reliability
- scalability
- elasticity
- agility
- geo-distribution
- distaster recovery

Cloud computing is a consumption-based model
	end-users pay for the resources they use
	Benefits of this model:
	- no upfront costs
	- no need to purchase and manage costly infra 
	- ability to pay for add'l resources when needed
	- ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.


Capital expenses vs  Operating Expenses

	CapEx - infrastructure -> assets,  are depreciated and amortized 
		requires significant up-front costs

	OpEx - cloud services no assets to amortize. 


Cloud service models

	IaaS
		infra as a service
		This cloud service model is the closest to managing physical servers. A cloud provider keeps the hardware up to date, but operating system maintenance and network configuration is left to the cloud tenant. 

		Most flexible bc you configure and manage the h/w running your apps.

	PaaS
		platform as a service
		This cloud service model is a managed hosting environment. The cloud provider manages the virtual machines and networking resources, and the cloud tenant deploys their applications into the managed hosting environment. 

		Produuctivity: users can focus on app dev only, bc the cloud provider handles all platform
		management.

		Disadvantage: platform limitations.  Evaluate those limitations.


	SaaS
		Software as a service
		In this cloud service model, the cloud provider manages all aspects of the application environment, such as virtual machines, networking resources, data storage, and applications. The cloud tenant only needs to provide their data to the application managed by the cloud provider.

		Disadvantage:
			software limitations
				bc you're using as-is software, you don't have direct control of features.
				consider software limitations.


Serveless computing

	Overlapping with PaaS, serverless computing enables developers to build applications faster by eliminating the need for them to manage infrastructure. With serverless applications, the cloud service provider automatically provisions, scales, and manages the infrastructure required to run the code.

	The serverless name comes from the fact that the tasks associated with infrastructure provisioning and management are invisible to the developer. 

Public cloud

	services offered over public internet.

Private cloud

	computing resources are for exclusive use of one
	org.

Hybrid

	combines public and private clouds but allowing
	data and applications to be shared between them.



Azure offers

	continuous innovation

	you have choices

	operate hybrid seamlessly 

	get security backed by a team of experts.



Azure Marketplace

	helps connect users with Microsoft partners, independent software vendors, and startups that are offering their solutions and services, which are optimized to run on Azure. Azure Marketplace customers can find, try, purchase, and provision applications and services from hundreds of leading service providers. All solutions and services are certified to run on Azure.

	Subscriptions and Management Groups
	-----------------------------------



	Resources, Resource Groups and Azure Resource Manager


	Resources
		instances of services you create

	Reousrce groups
		resources are combined into resource groups which act as a logical container
		into which Azure resources like web apps, databases, and storage accounts 
		are deployed and managed.


	Subscriptions
		a subscription groups together user accounts and the resources
		that have been created by those user accounts.

		For each subscription, there are limits or quotas on the amount of resources
		that you can create and use.

	Management Groups
		help you manage access, policy and compliance for multiple subs.
		all subs in a management group automatically inherit the conditions applied
		to the management group.

		You can apply policies to a management group that limits the regions 
		available for VM creation.



	Resource Manager

		is the deployment and management service for Azure.
		A management layer that enables you to create, update, and delete
		resources in your Azure account.

		You use management features like access control, locks and tags to secure
		and organize your resources after deployment.

		When a user sends a request from any of the Azure tools, APIs or SDKs,
		Resource Manager receives the request.
		It auth and authz the request.

		Benefits of RM:
			- declarative templates instead of scripts
			- manage resources as a group
			- consistency in deployment
			- ability to define dependencies between resources
			- ability to apply RBAC to all services
			- ability to apply tags to resources
			- ability to view costs for a group of resources.



	Account and Multiple Subs

	An Account can have one or multiple subs that have different billing models.
	You can use subscriptions to define boundaries around Azure products, services
	and resources.  

	Two types of sub boundaries:

		billing boundary
			this sub type determines how an Azure account is billed for using Azure.
			Azure generates separate billing reports and invoices for each sub.

		access control boundary
			applies access-mgmt policies at the sub level, 
			you can create separate subs to reflect diff org structures.
			e.g. one sub for your production workloads
			and another for your dev/test workloads

		Multiple subscriptions can be organized into Invoice sections.
		Each invoice seciton is a line item on the invoice.
		e.g. charges by Dept. or Project


	Billing

	Regions

		a geographical area on the planet that contains at least one, but potentially
		multiple datacenters that are nearby and networked together with a low-latency
		network.

		Regions give you flexibility to bring applications closer to your users.

		West US
		Canada Central
		West Europe
		Australia East
		Japan West

		Special:

		US DoD Central
		US Gov Virginia
		US Gov Iowa

		China East
		China North

	Region Pairs

		each region is always paired with another region within the same geography
		at least 300 miles away.  This allwos for the replication of resoures
		across a geography that helps reduce the likelihood of interruptions.
		If a region in a pair was affected by a natural disaster, services would
		automatically failover to the other region.


	Availability Zones

		Physically separate datacenters within an Azure Region

	Azure Functions

two implementations of serverless compute:

- Azure functions 
	
		can execute code in almost any modern language
		can be stateful (Durable Functions) or stateless


- Azure Logic Apps
		execute workflows built from predefined logic blocks

		are Stateful

		are designed in a web-based designer 
		can execute logic triggered by Azure services without writing any code

		every logic app workflow starts with a trigger 
		which fires when a specific event happens
		
		When the trigger fires, the Logic App engine creates a logic app instance
		taht runs the actions in the workflow.  

		These actions can also include data conversions and flows controls, 
		such as conditional statements, switch statemetns, loops and branching.

		You can create logic app workflows by using a visual designer on the Azure Portal
		or in Visual Studio.  Workflows are persisted as a JSON file with a known
		workflow schema.

		more 200 diff connectors and processing blocks 

		these are the most popular enterprise apps

		you can build custom connectors, and you can link connectors and blocks together.

		Azure Visual Designer - ideal for a business analyst role.

	Azure Storage

	- Disk Storage  for applications
  - File Storage  (shared FS)
  - Table storage (kv pairs)  NoSQL store
  - Queue Storage (messaging)

	- Clob Storage
	- Blob Storage

Storage Tiers
 - hot  (data accessed frequently)
 - cool (stored for 30 days)
 - archive (180 days)

To begin using Azure Storage, you first create an Azure Storage account.
A storage account provides a unique namespace for your Azure Storage data.

	Disk storage
	------------
		provides disks for Azure VMs.
		you can use standard SSD and HDD for less critical workloads, 
		premium SSD disk for mission-critical production applications, 
		ultra disks for data-intensive workloads e.g. SAP HANA, top-tier DBs.

	Blob Storage
	------------

		object storage solution 
		unstructured
		can manage thousands of simult uploads, massive amounts of video 
		constantly growing log files

		ideal for 
			serving images or docs directly to a browser
			files for distributed access
			streaming video and audio
			data for backup and restore, DR, archiving
			analysis data
			up 8TB of VM data.

	File Storage
	------------

		suitable for 
			- file shares 
			- store configuration files on a file share and access from VMs
			- write data to a file, and process or analyze the data later.

	Blob Storage
	------------

		to manage costs, it's helpful to organize data based on attributes
		like frequency of access and planned retention period.

			tiers:

			hot access (can be set at the account level)
			cool access ( ditto )
			archive access  (isn't avail at the account level)

		these tiers can be set at the blob level

	AI

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a category of computing that adapts and improves its decision-making ability over time based on its successes and failures. 

There are two basic approaches to AI. 

The first is to employ a deep learning system that's modeled on the neural network of the human mind, enabling it to discover, learn, and grow through experience.

The second approach is machine learning, a data science technique that uses existing data to train a model, test it, and then apply the model to new data to forecast future behaviors, outcomes, and trends.

Three product offerings from Microsoft

1. Azure Machine Learning

2. Azure Cognitive Services

3. Azure Bot Service
