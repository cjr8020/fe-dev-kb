Cloud service models

	IaaS
		infra as a service
		This cloud service model is the closest to managing physical servers. A cloud provider keeps the hardware up to date, but operating system maintenance and network configuration is left to the cloud tenant. 

	PaaS
		platform as a service
		This cloud service model is a managed hosting environment. The cloud provider manages the virtual machines and networking resources, and the cloud tenant deploys their applications into the managed hosting environment. 


	SaaS
		Software as a service
		In this cloud service model, the cloud provider manages all aspects of the application environment, such as virtual machines, networking resources, data storage, and applications. The cloud tenant only needs to provide their data to the application managed by the cloud provider.


Serveless computing

	Overlapping with PaaS, serverless computing enables developers to build applications faster by eliminating the need for them to manage infrastructure. With serverless applications, the cloud service provider automatically provisions, scales, and manages the infrastructure required to run the code.

	The serverless name comes from the fact that the tasks associated with infrastructure provisioning and management are invisible to the developer. 

Public cloud

	services offered over public internet.

Private cloud

	computing resources are for exclusive use of one
	org.

Hybrid

	combines public and private clouds but allowing
	data and applications to be shared between them.



Azure offers

	continuous innovation

	you have choices

	operate hybrid seamlessly
