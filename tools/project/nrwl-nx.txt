  workspace

    a folder created by NX
    consists of a single git repo with folders for 
      apps
      libs
      along with scaffolding to help with building, linting, testing

  app
    produces a binary
    contains minimul amount of code to packages many libs to create deployed artifact

    if we have two separate targets (desktop and mobile), we might have two
    separate apps.


  apps/
    booking/
      booking-desktop/
      booking-mobile/
    check-in/
      check-in-desktop/
      check-in-mobile/


  lib
    a set of files packages together that is consumed by app
    similar to node modules
    can be published to NPM, or
    bundled with deployed apps as is

    have well defined public API in the `index.ts` file

    some libs are used only by a partidular app, and
    should go into the appropriate directory


  libs/
    booking/ <-- app-specific lib

    even though such libraries can be used in more than one place, the goal 
    of creating them is not code reuse, but factoring the appication into
    well-defined modules to simplify the appication's maintenance


  typical NX workspace contains only 4 types of libs:

    feature
    data-access
    ui
    util
