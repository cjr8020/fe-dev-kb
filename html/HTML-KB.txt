Semantic elements = elements with a meaning.

Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

================================================================================

<nav>

  HTML5 element represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide
  navigation links either within current document or other documents.
  to define a set of navigation links.

    - not all links must be in a <nav> element which is intended only for 
      major block of navigation links;  typically the <footer> element 
      often has a list of links that don't need to be in a <nav> element.

    - a document may have several <nav> elements, e.g., one for site navigation
      and one for intra-page navigation.


article
-------

  HTML <article> element represents a self-contained composition in a document,
  page, application or site.

    e.g. forum post, magazine or news article, blog entry

      identified

    each article should be identified by typically a heading as a CHILD
    of the <article> element

      nested

    when article element is nested, the inner element represents an article
    related to the outer element.  E.g. the comments of a blog post could be
    <article> elements nested in the <article> representing the blog post.

header
------

  HTML <header> element represents a group of introductory or navigational
  aids.  It may contain some heading elements but also elements like a logo,
  a search form, etc.. 

    <header>
      <h1> Main Page Title</h1>
      <img src="mdn-logo-sm.png" alt="MDN logo">
    </header>


aside
-----

  HTML <aside> element represents a section of a document with content connected
  tangentially to the main content of the document (often presented as sidebar)


  1. The aside element can be used within or outside the article element

  2. When used inside the content of the aside element must be relevant to the 
  article content
  
  3. If you can remove the content of the <aside> element and the article content, 
  to which it is relevant, becomes incomplete then you should not be using 
  the <aside> element
  
  4. When used outside the article element the content of the aside element 
  must be relevant o your entire web page
  
  5. The aside element is a block level element
  
  6. You can use both block level elements (such as headings, <h1> - <h6>) and inline elements (such as emphasize, <em>) inside of the <aside> element

  
  
  can be used in two different contexts.  This depends on whether or not it is 
  inside or outside the article element.

  In magazines, you often see info-boxes pulled away from the actual content of
  the article, highlighting something with relevance to the article



  <aside> inside the <article>
  -----------------------------

  <article>
        <header>
                <h1>All About Flour<h1>
                <p class="byline">by Jane Doe</p> 
        </header>
        <section>
                <h2>The Two Types of Wheat</h2>
                <p>There … to rise.</p>
                <p>Where … with less protein.</p>
        </section>
        <aside>
                If you use organic flour you very often get better bread
        </aside>
  </article>


  <aside> outside the <article>
  -----------------------------

  used to mark up content which is relevant to your page as a whole - blogrolls,
  additional navigation, even adds - and wheh this is the scope of your aside, 
  it has to be placed outside of the <article> element.

  <aside>
          <h3>Foodblogs I like</h3>
          <a href="http://www.bakerella.com">Bakerella</a>
          <a href="http://sourdough.com/"> Sourdough.com</a>
          <a href="http://www.bakingobsession.com">BakingObsession</a>
  </aside>
  <article>
          <header>
                  <h1>All About Flour<h1>
                  <p class="byline">by Jane Doe</p> 
          </header>
          <section>
                  <h2>The Two Types of Wheat</h2>
                  <p>There … to rise.</p>
                  <p>Where … with less protein.</p>
          </section>
  </article>  



section
-------

  is a structural HTML element used to group together related elements.

  A section is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading.
  A web page could normally be split into sections for introduction, content, and contact information.

  the HTML <section> element represents a standalone section of functionality 
  contained within an HTML document, typically with a heading.

    Heading

  each <section> should be identified typically with a heading as a child 
  of the <section> element:

    <section>
      <h1>Heading</h1>
      <img src="bird.jpg" alt="bird">
    </section>

    <div> vs <section>

  do not use <section> as a generic container; this is what <div> is for,
  espetially, when sectioning is only for styling purposes.

  A rule of thumb is that a section should logically appear in the outline 
  of a document.


footer
------

  HTML <footer> element represents a footer for its nearest sectioning 
  content or root element.  Typically contains information about the author
  of the section, copyright or links to related docs

    Author

  enclose information about the author in an <address> element that can be 
  included into the <footer>

------------------------------ Example --------------------------

<article class="film_review">
  <header>
    <h2>Jurassic Park</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="main_review">
    <p>Dinos were great!</p>
  </section>
  <section class="user_reviews">
    <article class="user_review">
      <p>Way too scary for me.</p>

================================================================================

span tag
--------

	The <span> tag provides no visual change by itself.
	
	The <span> tag provides a way to add a hook to a part of a text or a part of a document.  When the text is hooked in a span element you can add styles to the content, or manipulate the content with for example JavaScript.
	
    Sample usage: a text with a span element that can be styled with CSS:
    
    	<p>My mother has <span class="blue">light blue</span>  eyes.</p>
    	
	Standard attributes:
	
		class
		
		dir 
			= Specifies the text direction for the content in an element
		
		id
		
		lang
			= Specifies a language code for the content in an element
		
		style
			= Specifies an inline style for an element
		
		title
			= extra info about an element
		
		xml:lang
    		= Specifies a language code for the content in an element, in XHTML documents
    	



What does the &nbsp; mean?
--------------------------

- no-break space

- it's a character entity

1) keep elements together
    if you want to put a space between two elements, but the browser
    should not break up these two parts in separate lines, then replace
    the ordinary space with a no-break space

    (e.g. in a table)

2) Create multiple spaces

    normal multiple spaces are collapsed to one by the browser:

    These     spaces    will collapse,
    But these&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbspare&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shown...





BASE HREF
---------



12.4 Path information: the BASE element
---------------------------------------

<!ELEMENT BASE - O EMPTY -- document base URI -->
<!ATTLIST BASE href %URI; #REQUIRED -- URI that acts as base URI --
  >


When present, the BASE element must appear in the HEAD section of an HTML document, before any element that refers to an external source. The path information specified by the BASE element only affects URIs in the document where the element appears.

For example, given the following BASE declaration and A declaration:

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"
   "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
<HTML>
 <HEAD>
   <TITLE>Our Products</TITLE>
   <BASE href="http://www.aviary.com/products/intro.html">
 </HEAD>

 <BODY>
   <P>Have you seen our <A href="../cages/birds.gif">Bird Cages</A>?
 </BODY>
</HTML>

the relative URI "../cages/birds.gif" would resolve to:

http://www.aviary.com/cages/birds.gif




    Page Redirect 
    =============

Use suspenders and a belt -- both the Refresh pragma and a JavaScript redirect in the <head> of the page, like this:

1.

<meta http-equiv="Refresh" content="0; url=http://site.com/page.html">

2. 
<script>
  window.location="http://www.mysite.com/mypage.html";
</script>

Make sure to set both url's the same, and be careful of the punctuation in the Refresh pragma.

3. 

The other way to do this is server-side via the .htaccess file in your web root.  Do this with caution, and always check your server documentation or with your server administrator to be certain it's allowed on your host -- though the technique is very much standard on UNIX/LINUX boxes.

Add a Redirect request to your .htaccess file in the following general form:

Redirect whatpage.html http://www.mysite.com/otherpage.html

In this example, whatpage.html is redirected to http://www.mysite.com/otherpage.html.


    Lists
    =====
    
Ordered Lists
-------------
    
<ol>
<li> ... </li>
<li> ... </li>
...
</ol>    

Unordered Lists
---------------

<ul>
<li> ... </li>
<li> ... </li>
...
</ul>

Unordered Lists, have been extended to allow the type of bullet to be specified.

    <ul type=disc|circle|square>

Note that on many browsers disc and circle appear the same.

You can also specify the bullet type with the <li> tag itself!

    <li type=disc|circle|square>


=================================================================

  forms
  *****

label element

  may be used to attch information to controls.  each label is associated
  with exactly one form control.

  attributes:
    for
    accesskey
    onfocus
    onblur

  the for attribute assocates a label with another control explicitly:
  the value for the `for` attribute must be the same as the value of the `id`
  attribute of the associated control elemnent.

    <label for="username">Username</label>
    <input type="text" id="username" name="username" />

  How to get youtube video thumbnail from YouTube API
  ***************************************************    

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2068344/how-do-i-get-a-youtube-video-thumbnail-from-the-youtube-api

"i3.ytimg.com"  works in place of "img.youtube.com"



Each YouTube video has 4 generated images. They are predictably formatted as follows:

http://img.youtube.com/vi/<insert-youtube-video-id-here>/0.jpg
http://img.youtube.com/vi/<insert-youtube-video-id-here>/1.jpg
http://img.youtube.com/vi/<insert-youtube-video-id-here>/2.jpg
http://img.youtube.com/vi/<insert-youtube-video-id-here>/3.jpg
The first one in the list is a full size image and others are thumbnail images. The default thumbnail image (ie. one of 1.jpg, 2.jpg, 3.jpg) is:

http://img.youtube.com/vi/<insert-youtube-video-id-here>/default.jpg
For the high quality version of the thumbnail use a url similar to this:

http://img.youtube.com/vi/<insert-youtube-video-id-here>/hqdefault.jpg
There is also a medium quality version of the thumbnail, using a url similar to the HQ:

http://img.youtube.com/vi/<insert-youtube-video-id-here>/mqdefault.jpg
For the standard definition version of the thumbnail, use a url similar to this:

http://img.youtube.com/vi/<insert-youtube-video-id-here>/sddefault.jpg
For the maximum resolution version of the thumbnail use a url similar to this:

http://img.youtube.com/vi/<insert-youtube-video-id-here>/maxresdefault.jpg
All of the above urls are available over https too. Just change http to https in any of the above urls. 

Additionally, the slightly shorter hostname i3.ytimg.com works in place of img.youtube.com in the example urls above.

Alternatively, you can use the YouTube Data API (v3) to get thumbnail images.


=================================================================  

  anchor tag 
  ----------

The <a>nchor element is simply an anchor to or from some content. 

As far as semantics and styling is concerned, the <a> element isn't a link (:link) unless it has an [href] attribute.


anchor tag without href
-----------------------

In HTML5, using an anchor element without an href attribute is valid. 
https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/text-level-semantics.html#the-a-element

  If the a element has no href attribute, then the element represents a placeholder for where a link might otherwise have been placed, if it had been relevant.



It is considered to be a “placeholder hyperlink.” You can use class and other attributes, but you can not use target, download, rel, hreflang, and type.

  tabindex=0 to make it focusable

NOTE: Take note that without an href the cursor: pointer style will not be automatically added to the element
